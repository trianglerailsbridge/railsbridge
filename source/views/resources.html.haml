        %h3 Install your tools
        %p
          Hopefully you got Ruby all set up on your laptop during Installfest.
          But, if you didn't, or you need to install it on another computer,
          you can follow the installation instructions here.

        %h3 Learning Sequence
        %p
          For a quick review of what we learned today, watch
          #{link_to "Ruby in 100 Minutes", "http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html"}.
        %p
          Once you've got Ruby basics down, the best way to learn is to make a
          practice project. Projects take you off the smooth path of a tutorial
          and out into the exciting wild lands. Pick a problem you care about.
          Start small and spiral out.
        %p
          Ruby on Rails is a web framework, that is, a set of libraries and tools
          to make a dynamic website. Come to the RailsBridge Rails workshop to
          learn more. If you want to get started on your own, thoughtbot's
          = link_to "Ruby Learning Trail", "http://upcase.com/ruby"
          maps out the route.
